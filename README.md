# WazHackModGUIUnnoficial
A graphical interface for creating class mods for WazHack

Extract it anywhere and run the .EXE

The program will compile the input into a text file formatted for WazHacks class modding features.
It will also create a mod folder and meta file.

Default values are set so that you can run the program, click save class and it will generate a mercanary class and a mod folder and meta text for it. 
All you have to do after saving your class is to open WazHack and enable your newly created mod.
By default the mod is called "Made With Wazhack GUI by Digineaux" and will be found in:
"C:\Users\"computerOrUserName"\AppData\LocalLow\Waz\WazHack\mods\Made With Wazhack GUI by Digineaux"

If a mod does not load correctly in game, it will likely have an error shown in red text when you view it in WazHacks mod menu. Please screenshot or copy paste that error when reporting issues.
